Development Environment 
Tools and Technologies Used: Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, php Frameworks: php(for backend) Database Management System: SQL IDE: Visual Studio Code Development Methodology: The Agile development methodology was adopted, promoting iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. This approach facilitated continuous feedback and ensured the final product meets user expectations. 
7.3. System Architecture 
The system architecture is designed for scalability, security, and maintainability, following a modular approach. Each component of the system can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, ensuring seamless integration. Key Components:  User Interface (UI): Developed using html and css for styling to provide a dynamic and responsive user experience.  Backend Services: Implemented using php , ensuring robust data handling and security.  Database: SQLite is used for efficient and lightweight data management.  APIs: RESTful APIs facilitate communication between the frontend and backend, Google Maps (for location tracking), Payment Gateways  Architecture Diagram:

7.4 User Interface Design 
The user interface design focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and responsiveness. It ensures users can easily navigate the platform and access its features. Design Principles: User-Cantered Design: Focused on the needs and preferences of the users. Consistency: Uniform design elements for a cohesive experience. Accessibility: Ensuring the platform is usable by people with disabilities. 
 
7.5 Functionality 
The platform includes several key functionalities to support the needs of billboards users: 1. User Registration and Login: Registration Process: New users can create an account by providing their name, email, phone number, and password. Login Process: Existing users can log in using their email and password. Validation: Input validation and security checks are in place to ensure data integrity and security
ADMIN  DASHBOARD TO check registered users and billboards maybe add new billboards ,check payment, edit billboards, delete billboard or manage bookings 
User library: Browsing Resources: Users can browse, search, and filter through available  materials. Resource Details: Detailed descriptions and previews for each resource
6 Security and Data Protection 
Security Measures The system prioritizes user data protection and platform integrity. Here's how: Authentication and Authorization: Secure login with encrypted passwords keeps unauthorized access at bay. Data Encryption: All sensitive data is shielded, both while traveling (in transit) and when stored (at rest). Regular Backups: Automated, frequent database backups safeguard against data loss. Secure APIs: All API endpoints are secured to prevent unauthorized access. Comprehensive Testing The platform undergoes rigorous testing to guarantee its functionality and reliability: 
 
Unit Testing: Every component is individually tested for proper operation. This includes validating input fields, button functionalities, and user interface elements. Integration Testing: Combined components are tested to ensure seamless collaboration. This involves testing interactions between the frontend and backend, database operations, and API calls. User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Feedback from a group of end-users is collected to confirm the platform fulfills their needs. Real-world scenarios are used as test cases to validate the user experience. Automated Testing: Repetitive tests are efficiently conducted through automated scripts. This includes regression testing to ensure new features don't disrupt existing functionalities. Deployment Process Moving the developed system from a local environment to a live production environment is crucial for deployment: Hosting Service: The platform is hosted on a dependable cloud service provider, guaranteeing high availability and scalability. Options like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure can be considered based on cost and performance. Deployment Pipeline: An automated pipeline for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) streamlines updates and maintenance. This involves code building, testing, deployment to a staging environment, and finally, production.
